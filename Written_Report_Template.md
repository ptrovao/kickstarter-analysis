# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The main objetive of the project is to help Luisa with her campaign. The points to be answered are how much she should ask for funding and the timing of releasing the project.   

### Analysis and Challenges
Following the instructions provided, a few challenges were overcomed by first try different set ups for excel formulas and pivot tables to see what the result would be. Secondly, if the first method didnt present the desired result a google search was done to see the best way to solve the task.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We can see that the best time for launch date would be between around April and August, probably because of the warm weather and people are willing to go outside. However, after May, there is a deceleration in the number of successful outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on Goals, we have have noticed that lower the budget for campaign higher the chances of the event to be successful.

### Limitations of the Dataset
One of the biggest limitations of the dataset is that the data is just part of a sample, it does not include the full population. Having said that, it is hard to predict the probability of success with 100% certainty. Also, much of the success of the campaigns is related to the piece/plot how is well written and is able to attract more viewers.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
We could have created some more graphs related to parent category or subcategory related to outcome, to distinguish what are the preference of people to watch.
